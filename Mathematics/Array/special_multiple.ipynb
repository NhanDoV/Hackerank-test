    "- You are given an integer N. Can you find the `least positive integer` X made up of only 9's and 0's, such that, X is a multiple of N?\n",
    "For example\n",
    "- $N = 5$ then $x = 90$\n",
    "- $N = 7$ then $x = 9009$\n",
    "#### Update\n",
    "- X is made up of one or more occurences of 9 and zero or more occurences of 0.\n",
